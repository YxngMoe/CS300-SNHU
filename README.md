What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
We were implementing different types of data structures into our code to grab data from different files and using them in useful ways. Some datastructures were hash, vectors, trees.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Data structures are critical to understand because you need them in order to further succedd in the computer science career path.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I made sure to never give up and always complete the tasks no matter how much it took.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I now understand multiple data structures and algorithms.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I now understand multiple data structures and algorithms. So i can easily implement them into future coding projects and I can undestand if a team member has implemented them also.
